Where are you? is a simple map services application based on Google Map API

WRU is a demonstrate of how to share location between group of people.
It has the ability to find the shortest path between two points.

Note: Sharing here is not private, every one will see you marker since the app is open for all.
If you want to make it private then it is your time to learn how to do that your self.
